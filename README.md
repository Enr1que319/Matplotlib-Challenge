# Pymaceuticals Analysis

[![](Img/Laboratory.jpg)]()

## Introduction

In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. A technical report of the study was generated with all the tables and figures needed.


### Tools

The following tools were used to do the analysis and the REST API

+ Python
    + Pandas
    + Matplotlib
    + Scipy
    + Random
- Jupyter Notebook


## Data

The information used is from the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 and is in a SQLite database and in .json format files, these can be found in the "Resources" folder, this was provided by TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey.
With this the analysis was performed as well as the REST API
