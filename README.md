# Pymaceuticals Analysis

[![](Img/Laboratory.jpg)]()

## Introduction

In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. A technical report of the study was generated with all the tables and figures needed.


### Tools

The following tools were used to do the analysis and the REST API

+ Python
    + Pandas
    + Matplotlib
    + Scipy
    + Random
- Jupyter Notebook





<!-- Look across all previously generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of notebook.
1.- Capomulin is one of the best drugs to treat the Tumor Volume (mm3) because the tumors decrease significantly 
2.- We can said that there is a direct relationship between weight and the volume of the tumor, with this we can said that  the heavier the mouse the bigger the tumor
3.- The gender of the mices do not affect the decrease or increase of tumors in the treatments -->
