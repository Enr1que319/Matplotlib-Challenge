<!-- Look across all previously generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data. Include these observations at the top of notebook.
1.- Capomulin is one of the best drugs to treat the Tumor Volume (mm3) because the tumors decrease significantly 
2.- We can said that there is a direct relationship between weight and the volume of the tumor, with this we can said that  the heavier the mouse the bigger the tumor
3.- The gender of the mices do not affect the decrease or increase of tumors in the treatments -->
